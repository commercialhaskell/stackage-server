# WARNING: Changing the hoogle version causes stackage-server-cron to regenerate
# Hoogle databases FOR EVERY SNAPSHOT, EVER. Usually, that's ok! But don't
# forget! The consequences are: (1) More disk usage. Hoogle databases are not
# cleaned up on the stackage-server-cron side, nor on the stackage-server side.
# (Yet. This will change.) (2) More bucket usage. While it's easy to say it's a
# drop in the literal bucket, such excessive misuse of storage makes
# administration, backups, disaster recovery, and many other DevOps concerns
# harder and harder. All but the latest LTS's database are literally never used
# anyway. (3) The Hoogle database schema is defined by the first three
# version components. Any more frequent regeneration is pure unadulterated
# waste. (4) Stackage's Hoogle search will be unavailable until the new
# databases have been generated.
