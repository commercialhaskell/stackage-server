        Stackage is an infrastructure to create stable builds
        of complete package sets. Think “stable Hackage”.

        Getting Started
    <p>For prerequisites and compiler installation instructions, please see the wiki page <a href="https://github.com/fpco/stackage/wiki/Preparing-your-system-to-use-Stackage">Preparing your system to use Stackage</a>.
    <p>
        To start using Stackage, choose your operating system below:
    <ul .operating-systems>
        $maybe win <- windowsLatest
           <li>
               <a href=@{StackageHomeR win}>
                   Windows & OS X (Haskell Platform-based snapshot)
        $maybe rest <- restLatest
           <li>
               <a href=@{StackageHomeR rest}>
                   Linux & non-Haskell Platform users

        <div .span9>
            <p>
                If the build succeeds, a new Stackage snapshot is created.
        <div .span3>
            <img src=@{StaticR img_stackage_png} .stackage>
    <div .row .stackage-process>
        <div .span3>
            <img src=@{StaticR img_haskell_png} .haskell>
        <div .span9>
            <p>
                The community can start using the new snapshot immediately!

            <p>
                Once you have submitted the pull request, a build will be started.
                There is a dedicated jenkins server at this location:
                <a href="http://jenkins.stackage.org">
                    jenkins.stackage.org
                From there you can track the progress, status and
                results of Stackage builds.
