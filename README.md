Server for stable, curated Haskell package sets

This repo is part of the [Stackage project](https://github.com/fpco/stackage),
and the live server can be viewed at https://www.stackage.org.

Inside the config directory, there are two files ending in `-sample`. They
should be copied to remove the `-sample` suffix for the site to work. We do it
this way to avoid accidentally committing real database credentials into the
Git repository.

Running the server will automatically download an SQLite3 database from S3
containing package metadata and snapshot information. Note that this is unlike
previous versions of this codebase, that stored that information in PostgreSQL,
and required that local development uploaded its own snapshots.

The SQLite3 database is generated by the `stackage-server-cron` executable in
this repository.
